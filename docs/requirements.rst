This document presents the abstract data model implemented by the Acumos Common Data Service.
The data model is explained in terms of entities in the system, attributes of the entities,
and relationships among the entities.  The details here are abstract in that they don't specify
data type, data length, table name, column name, etc.

Support for Federation
----------------------

The Acumos system is intended to be federated. This has implications for identifiers used in the system, because they will have to be usable globally:

* Multiple systems will be running in different organizations
* Information will be shared selectively across the systems
* A public "root" instance will be used to publish some information
* Users can publish their solutions for use by others.

Entity Overview
---------------

* Solution:

  - A downloadable, executable and shareable version of a trained statistical model

* Solution revision

  - A version of a solution with a user-assigned identifier

Attributes:

*    Unique ID
*    Name
*    Active (yes/no)


Role Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A role function is a name for an action that may be performed by a user within a specific role, such as createModel. The software system may grant access to specific features based on whether the user role function is assigned to the user making a request. Role functions are related to roles in a many:mnany relationship.  So for example, a "designer" role may have many functions such as "read", "create", "update" and "delete" while an "operator" role may have only the function "read".

Attributes:

*    Unique ID
*    Role ID
*    Function name

  - Redundant - the solution revision tracks artifacts.
  - Question: could this be used to prevent deletion of a docker image as long as a solution with that docker image exists?

* Usage statistics: number of views, number of downloads, number of ratings, average rating

  - These may be derived from other entities


Solution Artifact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* An artifact is a component of a solution revision.
* Example: a Docker image with one micro service that exposes one trained statistical model
* Example: a TOSCA model for deploying a solution revision
* Example: a trained statistical model
* The output of a machine-learning algorithm created by a data scientist using training data and on-boarded to the system; e.g., Python pickle or R binary object

Attributes:

*    The file image, treated as an opaque byte stream

     -  Very likely to be stored as a binary file in a Nexus repository, so the URL to the file can be stored as an attribute.

*    Unique ID for system use, a generated UUID to be globally unique

*    Type

     -   An artifact type can be either a statistical model, metadata, docker image or TOSCA file (and TBD).

*    Descriptive name

     -   Chosen by user. This name may not be unique.

*    URL

     -   Using this, the artifact image can be retrieved from a Nexus repository

Trained statistical model

A trained statistical model is the output of a machine-learning algorithm.  The model is an opaque byte array, probably stored as a binary file in a Nexus repository.

Docker Image

A docker image is generated by the system, containing a microservice which in turn makes the trained statistical model usable.
TOSCA Model

A TOSCA model is used to deploy a solution to a specific hosted environment; e.g., Rackspace. Multiple TOSCA models can be defined for each solution. TOSCA models may be shared with other users.

*    Levels of access

     -   For example, users might be modelers (data scientists) who upload models; integrators who build solutions in the design studio; or consumers who download and run solutions only.
     -   As one possible implementation, the EP-SDK represents privileges using roles and role functions.  A user is assigned one or more roles.  Each role is associated with one or more functions.  A function is a specific feature in the system. Still TBD if an external authentication system will deliver privileges like roles, or if all must be stored locally.

Users are related to user roles in a 1:many relationship; in other words, multiple roles may be assigned to a single user.
